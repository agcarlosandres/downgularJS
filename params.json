{"name":"Downgularjs","tagline":"Angular library for downloading files and storing them locally","body":"### What is downgularJS?\r\n\r\nSometimes, especially when building hybrid mobile apps, you need to download files to the device, and store them locally so you can access those files later from navigator. DowngularJS helps you build download queues to download and store those files, including localstorage features to allow stop downloads and restart them later, after closing the navigator/app.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How does it works\r\n\r\nIt's very simple to use: Just create a queue and add the urls of the files you want to download into that queue. You can start/stop the download process, and save/retrieve the queue in localStorage. \r\n\r\nYou'll find more information and a detailed example in the source code, on github.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Ionic Friendly\r\n\r\nAs it is an AngularJS module, it can be easily integrated with **Ionic Framework**.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
